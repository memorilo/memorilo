# Memorilo

Memorilo is an open-source desktop application for reading, note-taking, and
spaced-repetition learning. It keeps notes, books, annotations, and flashcards
in one local workspace.

## Features

- Write in Document or Outline mode with rich text, math, tables, images, and
  task lists.
- Keep daily journals and quickly find recent or favorite notes.
- Read and annotate EPUB, PDF, TXT, CBZ, and CBR files from OPDS book sources.
- Use an incremental reading workflow to turn annotations into notes and
  learning cards.
- Create flashcards, cloze cards, and image occlusions, then review them with
  FSRS scheduling.
- Work with whiteboards and spreadsheets alongside regular text topics.
- Search notes locally and optionally connect Anki or MCP-compatible AI tools.

Memorilo is under active development, and its interfaces and storage formats
may change.
